                <h1>Who is the flavor club?</h1>
                <p>Brianna Hernandez was first drawn to baking out of curiosity and quickly realized that it provided an escape from her daily stress. As she taught herself to bake, her stress-relieving hobby swiftly turned into a passion. She expanded her skills by practicing daily. Her enthusiasm has helped her set big goals for the future.</p>
                <h1>What are our plans?</h1>
                <p>Brianna moved to Utah and began working at her first restaurant. She worked tirelessly throughout the day and returned home, only to bake or cook into the night. She enjoyed making dishes her ancestors made and desired to create recipes inspired by them. Close to a year later, she moved back to California and began working at a restaurant in Orange County. The restaurant served Mayan dishes and it was there that she learned what kind of work was required to create a new recipe. With the help of the other chefs, she researched recipes and tested new ways to create historic dishes. Brianna has hopes to open her own restaurant soon. She is recreating the Aztec dishes her family members once made in a new and exciting way.</p>
