      <p>
        Brianna was drawn to baking out of curiosity and soon recognized that it provided an escape from her daily stress. As she taught herself to bake, her stress-relieving hobby quickly turned into a passion. She expanded her skills by practicing daily. She moved to Utah and began working in a restaurant. She worked throughout the day and returned home, only to bake or cook into the night. She enjoyed sharing her creations with others whenever possible. 
Close to a year later, she moved back to California. She wanted to perfect her recipes and recreate dishes inspired by her ancestors. She started working at a restaurant in Orange County, CA that served Mayan dishes. There, she learned what kind of work was required to create a new recipe. With the help of the other chefs, she researched recipes and tested new ways to create historic dishes. While working there, she met her now husband and they are happily expecting their first baby. Because the restaurant served Mayan food, Brianna left her job to focus on creating the Aztec dishes her family members once made. She is now focusing on her work at home and hopes to open her own restaurant soon.
